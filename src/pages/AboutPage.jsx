            <p>
                PalpAI is a prototype user interface of an intelligent adaptive learning
                platform with personalized interaction. It illustrates how AI-based
                educational systems can adapt content, difficulty and recommendations
                to each individual learner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application demonstrates several key ideas of the dissertation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>personalized learning paths for students;</li>
                <li>real-time tracking of progress and engagement;</li>
                <li>adaptive UI that supports different user preferences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This frontend is built with React and is intended to be connected to a
                Java backend in the next stages of the project.
